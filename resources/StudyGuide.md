# Exam Study Guide
The exam will be an overview of all the materials covered in class for the semester so far, focusing on software engineering processes, and requirements and design artifacts and practices. The exam will be a one hour timed Canvas Quiz that is open-book. You are free to use your notes, lectures slides, and other course materials and resources to complete the exam. You may **NOT** work with another person on this exam or use AI tools. Below is a general study guide to help organize your notes and preparation efforts. The exam content will include but is not limited to the following:

### Software Processes
* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of iterative and plan-driven processes
* Compare, contrast, and apply different plan-driven SE processes: (V-model, Waterfall)
* Compare, contrast, and apply different iterative SE processes: (Incremental, Prototyping, Spiral)
* Code-and-fix was the "process" of the 1950s
* Compare, contrast, and apply different agile-based processes: (Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal Agile Framework, Lean Software Development)
* Understand the differences between different types of agile-based meetings: (scrum/standup meeting, retrospective, sprint planning, triage, sprint review)
* Understand and apply basic parts of a repository

### Requirements
* Explain the difference between requirements analysis, specifiction, and elicitation
* Understand the difference between functional and non-functional requirements
* Describe how to apply requirements elicitation techniques: (surveys, interviews, focus groups/brainstorming, prototyping, ethnographies)
* Write a user story for a given scenario
* Understand the different between a use case and a user story

### Design
* Understand the difference between high-level/architectural, low-level, and UI design
* Apply architectural design patterns: (pipe-and-filter, event-based, layered, etc.)
* Understand and discuss different software design concepts (i.e., abstraction, modularity, S.O.L.I.D., etc.)
* Understand the differences between low-level design pattern families (creational, structural, and behavioral)
* Describe and apply UI design processes: (i.e., prototyping, wireframing, task flow analysis, storyboarding, etc.)
* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using design patterns
* Understand low-level design patterns (discussed in class) and how they can improve code
* Understand and discuss UI design heuristics
