### Based on your assigned GitHub repository, please answer the questions below:

* What is the overall goal of this project?
* Other than “Agile”, what software engineering process would you use to implement this system. Why?
* What type of maintenance focuses on changing non-functional aspects of your software?
  (a) corrective maintenance
  (b) preventative maintenance
  (c) perfective maintenance
  (d) adaptive maintenance
* You are in charge of adding a new feature to this product. How would you elicit requirements for this feature?
* Onboarding is the process where newcomers joining a development familiarize themselves with a project and its codebase. What are _two_ concepts discussed in class that could help onboard you if you were a new developer joining this project team?
* What approach would you use to deploy the program to users? Why?
* Assume this project is written in Java. If you were to rewrite this program in Python, explain why the cyclomatic complexity would be similar but Halstead's complexity metric would be different.
* Select one method or function in this program. Calculate the cyclomatic complexity of that function?
* Which type of testing focuses on input/output behavior of a program?
  (a) white box testing
  (b) black box testing
  (c) integration testing
  (d) exhaustive testing
* The team is facing delays in delivering the software to users. What is one Agile practice to help mitigate the delays? Please explain.
* True or False: Refactoring is the process of modifying code for improvement _without_ changing the behavior of the program.
* Assume this program has an extensive unit test suite that takes a significant amount of time to run. How could the number of test cases be minimized?
* Which git command would you use to add code changes to your local repository? Which one stages changes to prepare for adding to your working directory?
  (a) git pull
  (b) git push
  (c) git status
  (d) git commit
  (e) git add
