# Pair Programming Activity

Pair programming is a common practice in development environments where two software engineers work on a programming task 
together at the same computer. Review the lecture slide below to review the software engineer roles while participating in this process.

## In-Class Activity

For the following activity, find a partner in class with shared knowledge of a programming language. You must work with only **one** partner unless otherwise specified to receive credit. Each student must complete a designated part of the activity on their own machine, while the partner _actively_ participates in the coding.

> ### Roman Numerals

> Roman numerals are depicted by using seven different symbols: ``I, V, X, L, C, D and M`` to represent seven different numerical values: ``1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000`` that can correspond with any other number. For example, the most recent professional American Football championship game was Super Bowl LVII--which was Super Bowl 57. Complete the following for this activity:

> * One student will be the driver while the other navigates to write a function that converts an [integer to a Roman Numeral](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/).
> * Then, students will switch roles to develop a function that converts [Roman numerals to integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/).

The driver must complete their portion of the program on their own machine. When driving, _**each student**_ should add comments in the program to describe what the function does, who wrote it, and which IDE or text editor was used to write the code. Create your method(s) in a file named Roman.<ext>. You are not expected to come 
up with the most efficient or correct solution---this is an activity to practice pair programming and track attendance, not a job interview. Only the conversion 
methods are needed.

Each student must complete the following survey to receive credit: [https://forms.gle/dgdCG5Tw4wFgRZgG8](https://forms.gle/dgdCG5Tw4wFgRZgG8).
