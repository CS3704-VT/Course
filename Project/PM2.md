# Project Milestone 2: Pitch

This project milestone will focus on sharing your project idea and starting the development of your system.

### __Lightning Talk__ (12%)
Your group must complete an oral proposal presentation during class provding an overview of the project you wish to complete for the semester. This talk must include:

* a problem statement;

* your proposed solution;

* an overview of the requirements elicitation results; and 

* an initial mock-up UI design.

You may divide the presenting duties among your team however you wish, but the talk must be **_no more than 5 minutes_**. The slides for your presentation are due before class on October 14, and lightning talks will take place in class October 14 and 16. The order of lightning talks will be selected randomly and presented immediately before each class. Please be on time for class on these dates. Due to time constraints, there will not be time for Q\&A after each lightning talk.

**Rubric: [TBD]()**

### Process Deliverable II (2%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project. For your selected SE process, **you must include a retrospective, sprint review of the previous milestone, and sprint planning for the next milestone**. Example submissions include:

| Process | Sprint Review | Sprint Planning |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Prototyping | stakeholder feedback and/or explanation of how the prototype changed since PM1 | initial prototype of your system based on your project goal |
| Scrum  | submit notes for all teammates from _at least weekly_ scrum meetings | list of prioritized tasks for PM3 |
| Kanban | An updated Kanban board with completed PM2 tasks | Backlog with prioritized tasks to complete for PM3 |
| XP     | calculate [project velocity](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/velocity.html) (i.e., total function points per milestone) of the PM2 tasks | planning poker and project velocity estimation for PM3 |
| Spiral | review of encountered and mitigated risks from PM2 | identify PM3 objectives, anticipated risks, and how you plan to mitigate them |
| Waterfall | N/A | submit updated SRS document with requirements as well as high-level, low-level, and UI design contraints |
