# Project Milestone 2

This project milestone will focus on developing the requirements of your system.

### __Lightning Talk__ (12%)
Your group must complete an oral proposal presentation during class provding an overview of the project you wish to complete for the semester. This talk must include:

* a problem statement;

* your proposed solution;

* an overview of the requirements elicitation results; and 

* an initial mock-up UI design.

You may divide the presenting duties among your team however you wish, but the talk must be **_no more than 5 minutes_**. The slides for your presentation are due before class on October 14, and lightning talks will take place in class October 14 and 16. The order of lightning talks will be selected randomly and presented immediately before each class. Please be on time for class on these dates. Due to time constraints, there will not be time for Q\&A after each lightning talk.

### Process Deliverable I (3%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project (as described in your project proposal). Example submissions for different processes include:
* Prototyping: submit an informal prototype of your system based on project goal and prioritized requirements.
* Scrum: submit notes (include each teammate) from _at least weekly_ scrum meetings.
* Kanban: submit a depiction (i.e., screenshot, link, etc.) of completed and prioritized tasks in your team's Kanban board
* Agile: submit a summary of retrospective (retrospective) and prioritized tasks for the next milestone (sprint planning)
* Extreme programming: submit calculation of [project velocity](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/velocity.html) (i.e., total function points per PM2 task completed---not the requirements specification tasks below) and estimate velocity for next project milestone
* Incremental: submit prioritized requirements to factor into the next design milestone (and why they are prioritized)
* Waterfall: submit a simplified version of a software requirements specification (SRS) document [[example](https://assets.asana.biz/transform/4a6dce32-7fe3-42a9-9ff9-a22083597903/inline-project-management-software-requirement-document-template-3-2x?io=transform:fill,width:2560&format=webp)]
