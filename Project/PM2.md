# Project Milestone 2

This project milestone will focus on developing the requirements of your system.

### Process Deliverable I (3%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project (as described in your project proposal). Example submissions for different processes include:
* Prototyping: submit an informal prototype of your system based on project goal and prioritized requirements.
* Scrum: submit notes (include each teammate) from _at least weekly_ scrum meetings.
* Kanban: submit a depiction (i.e., screenshot, link, etc.) of completed and prioritized tasks in your team's Kanban board
* Agile: submit a summary of retrospective (retrospective) and prioritized tasks for the next milestone (sprint planning)
* Extreme programming: submit calculation of [project velocity](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/velocity.html) (i.e., total function points per PM2 task completed---not the requirements specification tasks below) and estimate velocity for next project milestone
* Incremental: submit prioritized requirements to factor into the next design milestone (and why they are prioritized)
* Waterfall: submit a MOSCOW analysis of the derived requirement specification tasks

### Requirements Analysis (6%)

Based on the results of your requirements elicitation, goals for your project, and course materials, please complete the following tasks:

1. Provide an example of five hypothetical non-functional requirements for your system. Be sure to include the specific type of requirement discussed in class, with each requirement coming from a unique category.

2. Provide an example of five hypothetical functional requirements for your system.

3. Write five formal use cases for your system and provide use case or sequence diagrams to represent each use case.

### Requirements Specification (6%)

Based on the results of your requirements elicitation, goals for your project, and course materials, please complete the following tasks:

1. Write four user stories from the perspective of at least two different actors. Provide the acceptance criteria for these stories.

2. For each user story mentioned above, estimate the amount of effort needed to complete relevant subtasks using function points. Explain your answer.
