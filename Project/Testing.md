### __Black Box Test Plan__ (3%)


### __Final Presentation__ (15%)

Instead of a final exam, your group must give a 10 minute oral presentation about your project. The presentation must include the original problem statement, an explanation and rationale for the proposed solution, updated use cases with diagrams, a visual representation of your project (i.e. mock user interface), a discussion on limitations and future work, processes and tools used, and things you learned. All project team members must participate in the final presentation for the project.
  
 **Rubric: TBD**

### __Final Report__ (15%)
The final report must be no more than 10 pages (not including references) and follow the same ICSE formatting guidelines as the Proposal Document. The final project report must contain the following:
    * a relevant _title_ and all group members listed as _authors_;
    *  the _abstract_ with feedback addressed;
    *  an updated _introduction_ incorporating proposal feedback to define the problem and motivate the project solution;
    *  a _motivating example_ to provide a scenario of how your project would be used and why it is relevant to software engineers working together;
    *  a _background_ to define any key terms or concepts related to your work (if applicable);
    *  an updated _related work_ citing relevant work and tools, including the novelty of your project; 
    *  a description of the _implementation_ design decisions, processes, and testing approach
    *  a _deployment plan_ section explaining how you would `deploy` and `maintain` your project for users if you were to release it;
    *  a _discussion_ explaining possible opportunities for future extensions and limitations of your project;  
    *  a _conclusion_ revisiting the problem statement and project work completed;
    *  and _references_ for any works that you cite.
    
   **Rubric: TBD**

### __Retrospective__ (2%)
At the conclusion of the project, you will asked to complete a brief group and individual retrospective about the team project. This will allow you to reflect on what went well, what didn't go well, and what you learned in addition to determining your contributions and the effort of your teammates towards the project. The overall grade will be impacted by reported group dynamics that cannot be determined through analyzing contributions to your repository.
