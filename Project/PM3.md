# Project Milestone 3

This project milestone will focus on the design of your system.

### Process Deliverable II (3%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project (as described in your project proposal). Example submissions for different processes include:
* Prototyping: A prototype/design sketch is already required for this milestone. Should be more formal/advanced than the previous milestone prototype.
* Scrum: submit notes (include each teammate) from at least weekly scrum meetings.
* Kanban: submit a depiction (i.e., screenshot, link, etc.) of completed and prioritized tasks in your team's Kanban board
* Agile: submit a summary of retrospective (retrospective) and prioritized tasks for the next milestone (sprint planning)
* Extreme programming: submit calculation of project velocity and estimate velocity for next project milestone
* Incremental: submit documentation explaining how design maps to prioritized requirements
* Waterfall: submit updated SRS document with high-level, low-level, and UI design contraints

### High-level Design (4%)

Describe which architectural pattern you would use to structure the system. Justify your answer.

### Low-level Design (4%)

Discuss which design pattern family might be helpful for implementing a specific subtask for this project. Justify your answer, providing a code or pseudocode representation _and_ an informal class diagram.

### Design Sketch (4%)

Design sketches provide a visual overview of the look and feel of your project. This may include but is not limited to one of the following:

* Creating a wireframe mockup of your project user interface in action.
* Creating a storyboard that illustrates a primary task that a user would complete with your project.

Provide a brief rationale (no more than 1 paragraph) explaining some of the design decisions for your program based on the provided sketch, and if/how it is different from what was presented during your lightning talk. Use concepts discussed in class to justify your design.

### Project Check-In
