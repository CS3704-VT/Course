# Project Milestone 3: Design

This project milestone will focus on the design of your system.

### High-level Design (4%)

Describe which architectural pattern you would use to structure the system. Justify your answer.

### Low-level Design (4%)

Discuss which design pattern family might be helpful for implementing a specific subtask for this project. Justify your answer, providing a code or pseudocode representation _and_ an informal class diagram.

### Design Sketch (3%)

Design sketches provide a visual overview of the look and feel of your project. This may include but is not limited to one of the following:

* Creating a wireframe mockup of your project user interface in action.
* Creating a storyboard that illustrates a primary task that a user would complete with your project.

Provide a brief rationale (no more than 1 paragraph) explaining some of the design decisions for your program based on the provided sketch, and if/how it is different from what was presented during your lightning talk. Use concepts discussed in class to justify your design.

### Process Deliverable III (3%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project. For your selected SE process, **you must include a retrospective, sprint review of the previous milestone, and sprint planning for the next milestone**. Example submissions include:

| Process | Sprint Review | Sprint Planning |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Prototyping | stakeholder feedback and/or explanation of how the prototype changed since PM2 | initial prototype of your system based on your project goal |
| Scrum  | submit notes for all teammates from _at least weekly_ scrum meetings | list of prioritized tasks for PM4 |
| Kanban | An updated Kanban board with completed PM3 tasks | Backlog with prioritized tasks to complete for PM4 |
| XP     | calculate [project velocity](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/velocity.html) (i.e., total function points per milestone) of the PM3 tasks | planning poker and project velocity estimation for PM4 |
| Spiral | review of encountered and mitigated risks from PM3 | identify PM4 objectives, anticipated risks, and how you plan to mitigate them |
| Waterfall | N/A | create an implementation plan [[example](https://asana.com/resources/implementation-plan)] |

* If your process is not listed below, please contact Dr. Brown for an equivalent submission.

### Project Check-In (1%)

_Required:_ Complete [this survey](https://forms.gle/fbq42BjdDuSdKYXd8) to provide an update on your team progress on the project so far this semester. Only one team member needs to complete this for the group.

_Optional:_ Please complete [this survey](https://forms.gle/F8SPwJv4EY1WuQTV6) to provide an individual update on your team's progress separate from the group survey. You do not need to complete this for PM3.
