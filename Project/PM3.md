# Project Milestone 3

This project milestone will focus on the design of your system.

### Process Deliverable II (3%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project (as described in your project proposal). Example submissions for different processes include:
* Prototyping: submit a prototype of your system (can be as formal/informal as needed)
* Scrum: submit the notes (including each teammate) from your most recent scrum meeting
* Kanban: submit a list of prioritized tasks from your task management system (and why they are prioritized)
* Waterfall: submit supplementary planning documentation
* Extreme programming: submit acceptance test criteria
* Spiral: submit risk analysis
* Code-and-fix: essay on why you used code-and-fix or up-to-date source code in your GitHub repository
For other processes not listed above, the instructor will contact you with the exact submission requirements for this task.

### High-level Design (4%)

Describe which architectural pattern you would use to structure the system. Justify your answer.

### Low-level Design (4%)

Discuss which design pattern family might be helpful for implementing this project. Justify your answer, providing a code or pseudocode representation _and_ an informal class diagram.

### Design Sketch (4%)

Design sketches provide a visual overview of the look and feel of your project. This may include but is not limited to one of the following:

* Creating a wireframe mockup of your project user interface in action.
* Creating a storyboard that illustrates a primary task that a user would complete with your project.

Provide a brief rationale (no more than 1 paragraph) explaining some of the design decisions for your program based on the provided sketch. Use concepts discussed in class to justify your design.
