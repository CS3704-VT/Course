# Project Milestone 1

### __Lightning Talk__ (12%)
Your group must complete an oral proposal presentation during class provding an overview of the project you wish to complete for the semester. This talk must include a problem statement, your proposed solution, how your proposed work relates to the overall project goal, and results from a requirements elicitation process (see below for details). You may divide the presenting duties among your team however you wish, but the talk must be **_no more than 5 minutes_**. There will also be a brief time of Q&A from students after each presentation on your proposed work. The slides for your presentation are due before class on September 23, and lightning talks will take place in class September 23, 25, and 27. The order of lightning talks will be random and presented immediately before each class.

#### __Requirements Elicitation (6%)__

Requirements Elicitation is the process of discovering requirements for your system. There are numerous ways to elicit requirements for software-products. We will discuss several examples in class (9/13 lecture). You must select one requirements elicitation technique and collect insights on requirements for your project idea from at least two other groups in class or a minimum of eight other students outside of your group. In your lightning talk, you must present the requirements elicitation technique you used and a brief overview of the results. Documentation of your requirements elicitation (i.e., survey questions and responses, interview questions and responses, etc.) must be submitted with PM1.

### Project Proposal (12%)

Your project team must also submit a project proposal document. The proposal must conform to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) formatting guidelines (see the [MS Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx), [Latex](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ) templates). The proposal must introduce your project and provide a high-level overview of the SE process your team plans to use. Your document should be no more than 2-pages (excluding references). Please check your document for typos and spelling or grammar errors. The proposal must contain:

* a relevant _title_ and all group members listed as _authors_;
* an _abstract_ briefly describing the problem and proposed solution;
* an _introduction_ that further explains the problem and motivates the need for the proposed solution;
* _related work_ presenting relevant software engineering tools or research studies; 
* a brief description of the _software engineering process_ your team plans to use for the project and why you selected this process;
* and _references_ to any appropriate citations, if applicable. 

 * You will receive feedback from the teaching staff on the document and presentation for your proposal to approve of your course project for the semester.
