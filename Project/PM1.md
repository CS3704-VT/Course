# Project Milestone 1: Requirements

This project milestone will focus on developing the requirements of your system.


### __Requirements Elicitation (3%)__

Requirements Elicitation is the process of discovering requirements for your system. There are numerous ways to elicit requirements for software-products. We will discuss several examples in class. You must select one requirements elicitation technique and collect insights on requirements for your project idea from at least 10 other individuals outside of your group, ideally people who would be target users of your product. In your lightning talk for PM2, you must present the requirements elicitation technique you used and a brief overview of the results. Documentation of your requirements elicitation (i.e., survey questions and responses, interview questions and responses, etc.) must be submitted with PM1.

### Requirements Analysis (3%)

Based on the results of your requirements elicitation, goals for your project, and course materials, please complete the following tasks:

1. Provide an example of five hypothetical non-functional requirements for your system. Be sure to include the specific type of requirement discussed in class, with each requirement coming from a unique category.

2. Provide an example of five hypothetical functional requirements for your system.

3. Write five formal use cases for your system and provide use case or sequence diagrams to represent each use case.

### Requirements Specification (3%)

Based on the results of your requirements elicitation, goals for your project, and course materials, please complete the following tasks:

1. Write four user stories from the perspective of at least two different actors. Provide the acceptance criteria for these stories.

2. For each user story mentioned above, estimate the amount of effort needed to complete relevant subtasks using function points. Explain your answer.

### Project Proposal (6%)

Your project team must also submit a project proposal document. The proposal must conform to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) formatting guidelines (see the [MS Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx), [Latex](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ) templates). The proposal must introduce your project and provide a high-level overview of the SE process your team plans to use. Your document should be no more than 2-pages (excluding references). Please check your document for typos and spelling or grammar errors. The proposal must contain:

* a relevant _title_ and all group members listed as _authors_;
* an _abstract_ briefly describing the problem and proposed solution;
* an _introduction_ that further explains the problem and motivates the need for the proposed solution;
* _related work_ presenting relevant software engineering tools or research studies; 
* a brief description of the _software engineering process_ your team plans to use for the project and why you selected this process;
* a section providing an overview of the requirements elicitation, analysis, and specification activities above;
* and _references_ to any appropriate citations, if applicable. 

* You will receive feedback from the teaching staff on the proposal and requirements documentation to approve of your course project for the semester.

**Rubric: [TBD]()**

### Process Deliverable (1%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project (as described in your project proposal). For your selected SE process, **you must include spring planning activities for the next milestone**. Example submissions include:

| Process | Sprint Planning |
|---------|-----------------|
| Prototyping | initial prototype of your system based on your project goal |
| Scrum  | list of prioritized tasks for PM2 |
| Kanban | a Kanban board (i.e., screenshot, link, etc.) with backlog of prioritized tasks for PM2 |
| XP     | planning poker outcomes to estimate effort for prioritized PM2 tasks |
| Spiral | identify PM2 objectives, anticipated risks, and how you plan to mitigate them |
| Waterfall | submit a simplified version of a software requirements specification (SRS) document for your system [[example](https://assets.asana.biz/transform/4a6dce32-7fe3-42a9-9ff9-a22083597903/inline-project-management-software-requirement-document-template-3-2x?io=transform:fill,width:2560&format=webp)] |

* If your process is not listed below, please contact Dr. Brown for an equivalent submission.
