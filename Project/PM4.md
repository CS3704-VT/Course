# Project Milestone 4


### Process Deliverable III (3%)

The submission for this deliverable will depend on the specific SE process model your team plans to use to complete the group project (as described in your project proposal). Example submissions for different processes include:
* Prototyping: submit an informal prototype of your system based on project goal and prioritized requirements.
* Scrum: submit notes (include each teammate) from _at least weekly_ scrum meetings.
* Kanban: submit a depiction (i.e., screenshot, link, etc.) of completed and prioritized tasks in your team's Kanban board
* Agile: submit a summary of retrospective (retrospective) and prioritized tasks for the next milestone (sprint planning)
* Extreme programming: submit calculation of [project velocity](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/velocity.html) and estimate velocity for next project milestone
* Incremental: submit summary of how test cases map to project scope, requirements, and design
* Waterfall: submit an updated SRS document with a comprehensive test plan outlining how test cases relate to the project scope, objectives, requirements, design, and deliverables.

### Black Box Test Plan

A test plan is a detailed document that outlines test cases for a given software system. Black box test plans are documents that use plain language for stakeholders to follow to verify the program. For this milestone, you must create a black box test plan with at least **ten** unique black box test cases with the required test case information (see a template in the Lecture Slides). Your test cases should also relate to the acceptance criteria of your project requirements (PM2) and design constraints (PM3).

* If you are not implementing your project, you may leave the Actual Results column blank (but it must be present in the plan to receive full credit). 
* If you are implementing your project, you may include the actual results if the test case is implemented or still keep the column blank.
