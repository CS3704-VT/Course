# Project Milestone 4

### Black Box Test Plan

A test plan is a detailed document that outlines test cases for a given software system. Black box test plans are documents that use plain language for stakeholders to follow to verify the program. For this milestone, you must create a black box test plan with at least **ten** unique black box test cases with the required test case information (see a template in the Lecture Slides). 
* If you are not implementing your project, you may leave the Actual Results column blank (but it must be present in the plan to receive full credit). 
* If you are implementing your project, you may include the actual results if the test case is implemented or still keep the column blank.
