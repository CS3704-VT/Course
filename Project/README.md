# Project

Software has a major impact on the entire world and in nearly every area of our lives. Software engineering is a complex activity, involving numerous sources of complexity and coordination to develop and maintain high quality software. To that end, the goal for the CS3704 course project this semester will be to develop a project to improve any aspect of software and its engineering. For your project, you should consider the software engineering processes and will utilize methods and tools for software development life cycle phases (mostly `requirements` and `design`) as discussed in class.

**Learning Outcomes:**
> * Use techniques and processes to design a software system
> * Create and communicate about the requirements and design of a software application

The goal of this project is to practice software engineering processes, tools, and methods related to software requirements and design, and to gain practical experience working on a software project in a team setting.

## Guidelines

Your project must aim to solve a real-world problem. You are free to satisfy this goal however you wish. You must work with a team and complete various deliverables throughout the semester. Try to be creative when proposing project ideas.

### Teams

You must work in teams of four to six students, unless otherwise specified. Work must be equally divided among the team members. Groups will be assigned based on students' provided preferences for teammates and randomly.

### Technology

All projects should be maintained on a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository. To track work, teams should utilize task management (i.e. GitHub projects) and/or issue tracking (i.e. GitHub issues) on GitHub.

## Deliverables

You will submit your project in multiple milestones throughout the semester. More details about the specific deliverables for your project are available below:
