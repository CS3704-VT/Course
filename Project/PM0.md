# Project Milestone 0: Project Introduction

Please complete this [survey](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/196188/quizzes/548854) on Canvas to provide project group preferences by 9/5 at 11:59pm. Official groups will be assigned before class on 9/9. For this project milestone, you will meet your project group and discuss potential ideas for your project. Upload a file (pdf or txt) or input the following information to the Canvas assignment with the following details:

1. Come up with a team name for your group.

2. Please list the names and PIDs of the team members who are present in your meeting (or knowingly absent)

3. Conduct a stand-up meeting as discussed in class. Summarize the details for each student here.

4. Based on the project details provided in class and on the course GitHub repository, what questions do you have about the project this semester?

5. Provide your preliminary project idea (or set of ideas). This is not a commitment to a project.
  
6. Come up with a team contract with your group members. This document should outline working style, meeting and communication expectations, and a team-specific AI policy (that does not overrule the class policy). By submitting this document, all teammates agree to adhere to the contents for the duration of the course project.
