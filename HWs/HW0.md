# HW 0

This homework will help you with some setup and preparation for the course.

## Course Overview

**TODO:** Review the [course syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jGqHKlM8QHy8utRZ1Kg8g8SqumzIuqXvaba-oTESLvI/edit?usp=sharing).

- [ ] Based on the syllabus and first lecture, fill out this [intro survey](https://forms.gle/7KCSGToUhecjwxYh6) with any questions, confusions, or concerns you still have about the course. Even if you do not have any questions, you still must complete the survey to receive credit!

## Version Control

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the version control system we will be using for this course. You may download the git client to your system [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Additionally, [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) are two popular cloud-based hosting services for Git.

**TODO: For this class, you will need access to GitHub for class activities (including HW0) and collaborating on your team project.** 

- [ ] If you do not have one already, create a GitHub account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

## GitHub Classroom

For CS-3704 this semester, we will try out using GitHub Classrooms in addition to Canvas for learning management. After creating a GitHub account and installing git, please join our [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/97977962-cs3704-vt-fall24-classroom).

**TODO:** To join the course GitHub Classroom, use the [invite link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/08b81a10232a2b82b13ff6e3dd344b58). If you have issues signing up, please contact Dr. Brown.

**TODO:** Complete the class [GitHub Starter Course](https://github.com/orgs/CS3704-VT/discussions/1) to famliarize yourself with GitHub and its various features. You will only need to complete the first "Optional Next Steps" item to receive full credit. There will be more in-depth practice with GitHub later in the semester.
